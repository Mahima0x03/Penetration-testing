#Active Directory Structure
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service for Windows network environments. It is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization's resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices and file shares, group policies, servers and workstations, and trusts. AD provides authentication and authorization functions within a Windows domain environment. 

ADDS - Active Directory Domain Services

Active Directory flaws and misconfigurations can often be used to obtain a foothold (internal access), move laterally and vertically within a network, and gain unauthorized access to protected resources such as databases, file shares, source code, and more.

AD user account with no added privileges can be used to enumerate the majority of objects contained within AD.

shows two forests, INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL and FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL. The two-way arrow represents a bidirectional trust between the two forests, meaning that users in INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL can access resources in FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL and vice versa. We can also see multiple child domains under each root domain. In this example, we can see that the root domain trusts each of the child domains, but the child domains in forest A do not necessarily have trusts established with the child domains in forest B. This means that a user that is part of admin.dev.freightlogistics.local would NOT be able to authenticate to machines in the wh.corp.inlanefreight.local domain by default even though a bidirectional trust exists between the top-level inlanefreight.local and freightlogistics.local domains. To allow direct communication from admin.dev.freightlogistics.local and wh.corp.inlanefreight.local, another trust would need to be set up.

#Active Directory Terminology

The Active Directory schema is essentially the blueprint of any enterprise environment. 

When an object is created from a class, this is called instantiation, and an object created from a specific class is called an instance of that class. 

GUID - Global Unique Identifier 

A GUID is a unique 128-bit value assigned when a domain user or group is created. This GUID value is unique across the enterprise, similar to a MAC address. Every single object created by Active Directory is assigned a GUID, not only user and group objects. The GUID is stored in the ObjectGUID attribute. When querying for an AD object (such as a user, group, computer, domain, domain controller, etc.)

SAM - Security Account Manager

SID - Security Identifier

A security identifier, or SID is used as a unique identifier for a security principal or security group. Every account, group, or process has its own unique SID, which, in an AD environment, is issued by the domain controller and stored in a secure database. A SID can only be used once. Even if the security principle is deleted, it can never be used again in that environment to identify another user or group.

DN - Distinguish Name

A Distinguished Name (DN) describes the full path to an object in AD (such as cn=bjones, ou=IT, ou=Employees, dc=inlanefreight, dc=local). In this example, the user bjones works in the IT department of the company Inlanefreight, and his account is created in an Organizational Unit (OU) that holds accounts for company employees. 


sAMAccountName

The sAMAccountName is the user's logon name. Here it would just be bjones. It must be a unique value and 20 or fewer characters.

FSMO - Flexible Single Master Operation

Tombstone

A tombstone is a container object in AD that holds deleted AD objects. When an object is deleted from AD, the object remains for a set period of time known as the Tombstone Lifetime, and the isDeleted attribute is set to TRUE.


AD Recycle Bin

The AD Recycle Bin was first introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 to facilitate the recovery of deleted AD objects. This made it easier for sysadmins to restore objects, avoiding the need to restore from backups, restarting Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), or rebooting a Domain Controller.


Domain Controllers

Domain Controllers are essentially the brains of an AD network. They handle authentication requests, verify users on the network, and control who can access the various resources in the domain. All access requests are validated via the domain controller and privileged access requests are based on predetermined roles assigned to users. It also enforces security policies and stores information about every other object in the domain.



Kerberos, DNS, LDAP, MSRPC - Protocols

The relationship between AD and LDAP can be compared to Apache and HTTP. The same way Apache is a web server that uses the HTTP protocol, Active Directory is a directory server that uses the LDAP protocol.


NTLM Authentication

LM and NTLM here are the hash names, and NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT hash



NTLM is also vulnerable to the pass-the-hash attack, which means an attacker can use just the NTLM hash (after obtaining via another successful attack) to authenticate to target systems where the user is a local admin without needing to know the cleartext value of the password.


500 is the Relative Identifier (RID). 500 is the known RID for the administrator account

OUs are useful for grouping users, groups, and computers to ease management and deploying Group Policy settings to specific objects in the domain. 

Groups are primarily used to assign permissions to access resources.

Groups in Active Directory have two fundamental characteristics: type and scope. The group type defines the group's purpose, while the group scope shows how the group can be used within the domain or forest. 

There are three different group scopes that can be assigned when creating a new group.

    Domain Local Group
    Global Group
    Universal Group


Group scopes can be changed, but there are a few caveats:

    A Global Group can only be converted to a Universal Group if it is NOT part of another Global Group.

    A Domain Local Group can only be converted to a Universal Group if the Domain Local Group does NOT contain any other Domain Local Groups as members.

    A Universal Group can be converted to a Domain Local Group without any restrictions.

    A Universal Group can only be converted to a Global Group if it does NOT contain any other Universal Groups as members.




Global Group -converts-> Universal Group

Domain Local -converts-> Universal Group

Universal Group -converts-> Domain Local without any restictions

Universal Group -converts-> Global Group

# Server Operators Group Details

Get-ADGroup -Identity "Server Operators" -Properties *


# Domain Admins Group Membership

Get-ADGroup -Identity "Domain Admins" -Properties * | select DistinguishedName,GroupCategory,GroupScope,Name,Members

This privilege allows us to impersonate a token of a privileged account such as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This could be leveraged with a tool such as JuicyPotato, RogueWinRM, PrintSpoofer, etc., to escalate privileges on a target system.

#General Active Directory Hardening Measures
The Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement.


#LAPS

Accounts can be set up to have their password rotated on a fixed interval (i.e., 12 hours, 24 hours, etc.). This free tool can be beneficial in reducing the impact of an individual compromised host in an AD environment. 

#Audit Policy Settings (Logging and Monitoring)

Every organization needs to have logging and monitoring setup to detect and react to unexpected changes or activities that may indicate an attack. Effective logging and monitoring can be used to detect an attacker or unauthorized employee adding a user or computer, modifying an object in AD, changing an account password, accessing a system in an unauthorized or non-standard manner, performing an attack such as password spraying, or more advanced attacks such as modern Kerberos attacks.


#Update Management (SCCM/WSUS)

WSUS - Windows Server Update Service (WSUS)
SCCM - System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) 

Proper patch management is critical for any organization, especially those running Windows/Active Directory systems. The Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) can be installed as a role on a Windows Server and can be used to minimize the manual task of patching Windows systems. System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) is a paid solution that relies on the WSUS Windows Server role being installed and offers more features than WSUS on its own.

gMSA - Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)

A gMSA is an account managed by the domain that offers a higher level of security than other types of service accounts for use with non-interactive applications, services, processes, and tasks that are run automatically but require credentials to run. They provide automatic password management with a 120 character password generated by the domain controller. 


#Security Groups

Security groups offer an easy way to assign access to network resources. They can be used to assign specific rights to the group (instead of directly to the user) to determine what members of the group can do within the AD environment. Active Directory automatically creates some default security groups during installation. Some examples are Account Operators, Administrators, Backup Operators, Domain Admins, and Domain Users. These groups can also be used to assign permission to access resources (i.e., a file share, folder, printer, or a document). Security groups help ensure you can assign granular permissions to users en masse instead of individually managing each user.

#Account Separation

Administrators must have two separate accounts. One for their day-to-day work and a second for any administrative tasks they must perform. For example, a user could log into their machine using their sjones account to send/receive an email, create documents, etc. They should have a separate account, such as sjones_adm, to access a secure administrative host used to perform administrative tasks. This can help ensure that if a user's host is compromised (through a phishing attack, for example), the attacker would be limited to that host and would not obtain credentials for a highly privileged user with considerable access within the domain. 



#Periodically Auditing and Removing Stale Users and Objects

It is important for an organization to periodically audit Active Directory and remove or disable any unused accounts. For example, there may be a privileged service account that was created eight years ago with a very weak password that was never changed, and the account is no longer in use. Even if the password policy had since been changed to be more resistant to attacks such as password spraying, an account such as this may be a quick and easy foothold or method for lateral movement or privilege escalation within the domain.

#Auditing Permissions and Access

Organizations should also periodically perform access control audits to ensure that users only have the level of access required for their day-to-day work. It is important to audit local admin rights, the number of Domain Admins (do we really need 30 of them?), and Enterprise Admins to limit the attack surface, file share access, user rights (i.e., membership in certain privileged security groups), and more.

#Audit Policies & Logging

Visibility into the domain is a must. An organization can achieve this through robust logging and then using rules to detect anomalous activity (such as many failed login attempts that could be indicative of a password spraying attack) or indicators that a Kerberoasting attack is being attempted. These can also be used to detect Active Directory enumeration. It is worth familiarizing ourselves with Microsoft's Audit Policy Recommendations to help detect compromise.

#Using Restricted Groups

Restricted Groups allow for administrators to configure group membership via Group Policy. They can be used for a number of reasons, such as controlling membership in the local administrator's group on all hosts in the domain by restricting it to just the local Administrator account and Domain Admins and controlling membership in the highly privileged Enterprise Admins and Schema Admins groups and other key administrative groups.


#Group Policy Objects (GPOs)

A Group Policy Object (GPO) is a virtual collection of policy settings that can be applied to user(s) or computer(s). GPOs include policies such as screen lock timeout, disabling USB ports, enforcing a custom domain password policy, installing software, managing applications, customizing remote access settings, and much more. Every GPO has a unique name and is assigned a unique identifier (a GUID). They can be linked to a specific OU, domain, or site. A single GPO can be linked to multiple containers, and any container can have multiple GPOs applied to it. They can be applied to individual users, hosts, or groups by being applied directly to an OU. Every GPO contains one or more Group Policy settings that may apply at the local machine level or within the Active Directory context.
